 First sentence  painfully misguided 

A week is a time unit equal to seven days, used by the Jews at least since the time of Abraham[1], who probably lived between 2000 BCE and 1630 BCE[2].

OK, let us count the ways this makes no sense.

1) """"used by the Jews at least since the time of Abraham""""  since Abraham is the earliest figure in the Old Testament whom one might reasonably call a Jew, the """"at least"""" makes no sense.

2) Abraham to the best of my knowledge is not recorded in Genesis as using a calendar of any sort. The citation attached this statement refers to Moses, an entirely different figure.

3) Abraham is a legendary figure who may or may not have existed, and who is only referred to in the books of the bible, written hundreds or thousands of years after his supposed death.  I don't want to start a fight on religion, but his historicity is certainly up for debate, and a citation of a 100-year-old encyclopedia from a religious institution based in part the Abraham narrative isn't really a reliable source.

Surely the ancient Jewish use of the seven-day week ought to be mentioned in the lede, as it is the ultimate origin of the West's seven-day week, but the first sentence as currently written is nonsense.  Any suggestions on rewrites?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I feel that it would be effective, either in its own section or within Origins, to expand on the audiences that ethnographic films are geared towards.  The article now seems to focus well on the aesthetic and historical context and the scientific research and study that can be done.  However, it is only slightly mentioned through  """"Nai, the Story of a !Kung Woman"""" on how the actual subjects or indigenous tribes react-to and can utilize this film.

In order to expand on this topic, I was thinking of a rough statement like this would be ideal:

Indigenous tribes and people often have clearly defined practical reasons for participating in ethnographic films.  Such reasons include creating a record of their lives for future generations, warning authorities of potential problems, exchanging cultural information with other cultural groups and educating dominant cultures.Aufderheide, Patricia. Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007.  An ethnographic film by indigenous creators can also concentrate heavily on a particular movement towards indigenous activism.  The way an activist approach is accomplished is when filmmakers approach the issue with a tactic of openness, which ultimately no longer makes the camera a transparent object and instead an actor on stage that is allowed to be lead by its subjects.Aufderheide, Patricia. Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007

Croatian Women's Cup finals
I stumbles upon a Croatian newspaper archive. http://library.foi.hr/nv/default.aspx?G=1&u;= Those newspapers cover football at like 3 pages per day. I wondered if one is able to find results or at least runner-ups from 1992 to 2001. As i don't speak Croatian and don't know the dates of the finals, i can't come up with good searchterm to create few good results. Maybe you could have a short try at that site? Something like women's cup final, women's football, year final, or cupwinner + final or something. Thanks in advance. -

 Article importance assessment drive... 

Whoa! I was this close to raising an issue with the WP 1.0 bot, because it looked like it was almost 100 articles off, and noone is assessing that many articles a day... -)   
All in a day's work ;-) Mind you, 99% of everything I assessed received a low importance rating. It would sure be easier to keep them in check if WP:CRO templates were marked """"low importance"""" (and """"stub"""") by default, requiring manual input only for quality/importance upgrades. Speaking of which, if one wanted to adapt WP:Germany's version of the table depicting importance scale, where would one paste it at WP:CRO project's page? Should I just put it on talk page until we find a better place for it?   ([[User talk:Timbouctou|talk]]) 
From time to time I assess a couple of articles, and usually it's """"low"""" because these are easy to pick: villages, barely notable films and such. Yeah, it's a chore, but in this case occasional (or semi-permanent, to be honest) backlogs don't really hurt either...
Well, the only proper place for the table is surely Wikipedia:WikiProject Croatia/Assessment, i.e. the assessment subpage (currently used for something slightly different, but this is easily fixable). Maybe the time to introduce it has come... I'm not sure myself, the project might offer an answer.   
Just noticed you tried to add the quality scale... I've wrapped it in , which prevents it from messing up the main page. Not really a solution - ideally the assessment page and what is displayed in the Assessment frame should be entirely different things - but it works, kind of.   

 Re: Maps in infobox settlement 

There's an intermediate template that you'd have to create, or use a parameter of the existing Template:Location map Croatia. If the coordinates match, the latter could work. But, I don't know offhand if and how this extra parameter fits into Template:Infobox settlement parameters.   

 Henlein 

I found out that while with Građanski Zagreb, the Austrian Karl Henlein was actually a coach/player. He is former Austrian international. Here (3rd paragraph) is says that Gradjanski had 2 Austrian internationals, refering to Henlein and probably Rupec. That makes me doubt if Jaroslav Šifer (Schiffer) ever got to play with Austria, as he played in this same period as well in the club, thus, if Sifer was Austrian international, they would have been 3, and not 2, as mentioned. All sources say that J. Šifer was only Yugoslav international, but the only source claimng he played for Austria, that I know, is RSSSF. Any ideas?

Hi Demhem,

Back in December, you got either an AfD or PROD notification, which was part of the template testing project's experiments. If you could go here and leave us some feedback about what you think about the new versions of the templates we tested (there are links to the templates), that would be very useful.
